				<h2 class="editable">What is the Future of Work</h2>
				<p class="editable">What will our future careers be like? They will surely be technology enhanced in a way that makes a person more agile, creative and productive. Many jobs that exist today, will surely be replaced with robots and some degree of AI & Analytic software solution. We must also be mindful of the fact however that humans are evolved beings from a natural environment on this Earth and that we are social creatures. We actually need clean and “green” environments to have a high quality of life. I believe it is a foregone conclusion that the future of humanity is going to be heavily influenced and modified by technology - the key is to embrace this while keeping our humanity about us. Everyone has a role to play, a contribution to make, and a life to live.</p>

				<h2 class="editable">How It Works</h2>
				<p class="editable">As a part of the Future of Work, senior leaders will move from approaching sustainability as something that’s currently seen as "nice to have", to a critical and central aspect of their operations, driving long-term bottom line profitability and innovation. They will learn how to integrate this in every imaginable aspect, from using Sustainability principles to drive down energy consumption; resource consumption and waste generation; to worker productivity and wellness; product and organizational design; as well as employee attraction, and retention; even customer attraction and retention.</p>
				<p class="editable">
					Sustainability is the differentiating, strategic concept for the Future of Work. It becomes embedded in everything a company does until it is simply Business As Usual, and no longer the domain of a CSR or Sustainability department.
				</p>
				<p class="editable">
					I work with our members in both substantive 1-1 sessions as well as regular peer roundtables to identify and share what actions Senior Executives need to be taking to drive their organizations and teams to be ready to take advantage of the benefits, as well as be prepared for the risks that are coming. Using my existing global relationships and through in-depth research, I identify potential solutions specific to the opportunities and risks identified and introduce these concepts to my clients.
