				<h2 class="editable">Why you should work with FutureMax</h2>
				<p class="editable">The FutureMax Institute is a unique company based on the CEO, Paul Beddie’s, commitment and passion for sustainability and his deep desire to contribute to solving the causes of man-made climate change.  Critically this sustainability commitment comes with a simultaneously deep desire to improving long-term corporate profitability and quality of life for all people. We are particularly strong in providing services for companies operating in the world’s fastest and most dynamic region, Asia, where Paul has been living and working since 1991 and where he has a deep understanding of the various business practices and cultures across the region.
				</p>
				<p class="editable">FutureMax applies a pragmatic and financially realistic approach with our clients to embed sustainability as a core, strategic operating principle in their company’s DNA. It goes beyond the traditional environmental, built environment approach to sustainability and also includes organisational design, worker productivity and how to leverage new technologies such as AI and Blockchain to ensure we have a liveable and equitable future for all of humanity.</p>

				<h3 class="editable">I have known Paul for 20 years. His decades of on-the-ground global experience gives his insights and advice a very practical edge, both from knowing what he is talking about but also having personally experienced much of what he advises his clients to do. Paul’s work at the world’s largest advisory firms and his subsequent involvement in entrepreneurial companies uniquely qualifies him in combining that knowledge into his current passion to address sustainability, linking technology and people.</h3>
