				<h2 class="editable">What's it like to work with FutureMax Institute?</h2>
				<p class="editable">I do not have a methodology or set of ppt’s & spreadsheets that you can take away with you to fix and standardize a process.  If you want fixed processes, use software – its a perfect solution.  Repetitive tasks done with perfection and absolute accuracy over millions of times  – robots are your answer.  If you expect to deal with lots of people in the future however you will need different and more flexible approaches.  People are messy – how to best merge with technology.  How to create a physical environment that makes people more productive & creative in parallel? </p>
				<p class="editable">I don’t have the answers ready to give you but I have the background and experiences to help guide and work with you to create your unique strategy and action plan to achieve a globally leading and sustainable Future of Work organization. </p></p>
