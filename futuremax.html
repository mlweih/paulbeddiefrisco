				<h2 class="editable">Why you should work with FutureMax</h2>
				<p class="editable">The FutureMax Institute is a unique company based on the CEO’s, Paul Beddie, commitment and passion for sustainability and a deep desire to contribute to solving the causes of man-made climate change while simultaneously improving long-term corporate profitability and quality of life for all. We are particularly strong in providing our services for companies operating in the world’s fastest and most dynamic region, Asia where Paul has been living and working since 1991 and he has a deep understanding of the various business practices and cultures across the region.
				</p>
				<p class="editable">We do this by developing pragmatic and financially realistic approaches with our clients to embed sustainability as a core, strategic operating principle in company’s overall DNA.  It goes beyond the traditional environmental, built environment approach to sustainability and also includes organizational design, worker productivity and how to leverage new technologies such as AI and Blockchain to ensure we have a livable and equitable future for all of humanity.</p>
				<p class="editable">
					We provide both a strategic, long-term approach on a retainer fee basis as well as more tactical solutions through a network of global partners who provide clearly defined solutions targeting specific issues on either a fixed fee or long-term “as a service” basis.

				<h3 class="editable">I have known Paul for 20 years. His decades of on-the-ground global experience gives his insights and advice a very practical edge, both from knowing what he is talking about but also having personally experienced much of what he advises his clients to do. Paul’s work at the world’s largest advisory firms and his subsequent involvement in entrepreneurial companies uniquely qualifies him in combining that knowledge into his current passion to address sustainability, linking technology and people.</h3>
