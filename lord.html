				<h2 class="editable">Objectives</h2>
				<p class="editable">The client was under government pressure to eliminate fugitive VOC emissions from chemical process equipment in a very short time.  The local government environmental authority was considering financial penalties or worse if a solution, to be determined by our client, was not implemented immediately.
