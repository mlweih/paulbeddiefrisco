				<h2 class="editable">Personal Life</h2>
				<p class="editable">I currently reside in Shanghai, China with my Japanese wife. Our 3 children are living in the US and all are pursuing incredible lives to be the best artists they can possibly be.</p>
				<p>
					I particularly love to travel and I’m pretty good at the planning phase - I tend to be our designated family travel and holiday planner and have a knack for finding those cool holiday home rentals (was doing it long before Airbnb became a thing!).  I’ve traveled extensively for business around the world but I still have a lot of places to go as tourist so I’m looking forward to doing some more of that in the second half of my life.
				</p>
				<p>
					I’ve been a swimmer all my life (even before I could walk) and I swam competitively until the age of 15. Occasionally I dabble in sailing, golf, bike-riding and skiing but I usually need my friends to take the initiate and ask me along. I’ve been a news junkie my whole life, and am an avid reader of The Economist newspapaer.
