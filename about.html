				<h2 class="editable">The Backstory</h2>
				<p class="editable">Paul has always been a little different - born in California, grew up in New Orleans he’s lived more years of his life in Tokyo than any other city and more than half of his life has been lived outside of the US in Europe and Asia.

From the age of 13 he had his first international experience in Asia, and knew then that a driving theme of his life would be global engagement. The themes of <strong>Sustainability, Contribution and Integrity</strong> would come a few years later after graduating from a New England boarding school and receiving his undergraduate degree in International Affairs.

<strong>Trust, quality and empathy</strong> developed in the initial decade of his work life, starting with a 15-person start-up that was making one of the first laptop computers. Soon Paul decamped for Japan, and joined a leading Japanese EPC firm in their new Environmental Business Development Dept.  After a number of years and mentoring by several incredible Japanese and American mentors he shifted his career to Management Consulting, first with <a href="http://www.deloitte.com">Deloitte Consulting</a> and <a href="https://www.capgemini.com/consulting/">Cap Gemini Ernst & Young</a> in Australia and Japan, and then onto smaller, more entrepreneurial enterprises like PeopleSoft and Headstrong Capital Markets where he had Asia wide responsibilities. Shifting from a manager to a leader who motivates and inspires others began to occur as his experiences and exposure to more cultures expanded and he proved his own resilience living through the Great Financial Crises in the late 2000’s.

He founded his first company, Isity Global, in 2015. An incredibly rewarding, challenging and humbling experience, he built a Sustainability and Smart Cities integration company from scratch and received multiple award and recognition for the work done. In 2017 it became of a listed Australian entity where he remains a shareholder.

FutureMax is the embodiment of Paul's passion and purpose to be centered on Sustainability, Globalization, and making a significant Contribution to helping people and the companies they work in. Leveraging nearly 30 years of professional experiences and 50 years of life experiences to help our clients get ready for and maximize their value in the exciting and fast changing future of work.</p>

				<h2 class="editable">Personal Life</h2>
				<p class="editable">Paul currently resides in Shanghai, China with his Japanese wife where they recently have become “empty nesters”. Their 3 children are now all living in the US and all are pursuing incredible lives to be the best artists they can possibly become.
				</p>
				<p>
					Paul particularly loves to travel and is pretty good at the planning phase - he tends to be the designated family travel and holiday planner and has a knack for finding those cool holiday home rentals (was doing it long before Airbnb became a thing!). He’s traveled extensively for business around the world but still has a lot of places to go as tourist, so is looking forward to doing some more of that in the second half of his life.
				</p>
				<p>
					Paul's been a swimmer all of his life (even before he could walk), and he swam competitively until the age of 15. Occasionally he dabbles in sailing, golf, bike-riding and skiing but often needs his friends to take the initiate and ask him along. A news junkie his whole life, he’s an avid reader of The Economist newspaper.
