				<h2 class="editable">A Sample of Paul's Experience</h2>
				<p>
					After 27 years of working in Asia in varied and increasingly senior roles, there’s hardly a major Asian airport that Paul can travel through and not run into someone he knows. Paul has a breadth of business leadership and strategy experience and knowledge from startups to mergers, to expansions to sales. Paul makes things happen bringing speed to projects to ensure execution is achieved and strategic plans and goals are met all whilst having a vision of a sustainable world. Every role Paul has had has resulted in expansions, developing business opportunities to exceed stakeholders expectations beyond what was thought possible. Projects of magnitude suit him best, giving him the opportunity to access his global network creating change all whilst managing multiple opportunities at the one time.

				<h2 class="editable">The Backstory</h2>
				<p class="editable">Paul has always been a little different - born in California, grew up in New Orleans he’s lived more years of his life in Tokyo than any other city and more than half of his life has been lived outside of the US in Europe and Asia. From the age of 13 he had his first international experience in Asia and knew then that a driving theme of his life would be global engagement. The themes of <strong>sustainability, contribution and integrity</strong> would come a few years later after graduating from a New England boarding school and receiving his undergraduate degree in International Affairs. The geopolitical, economic and environmental global changes that have occurred since were unfathomable at the time.</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Trust, quality and empathy</strong> in the initial decade of his work life shifting from a manager to a leader who motivates and inspires others. FutureMax is the embodiment of his passion and purposed to be centred on sustainability, globalisation and making a significant contribution to helping people and the companies they work in. Leveraging nearly 30 years of professional experiences and 50 years of life experiences to help our clients get ready for and maximise their value in the exciting and fast changing future of work.
