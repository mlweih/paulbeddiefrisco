The solution we gave was a custom set of interventions including VOC monitoring, physical barriers and reconfigured exhaust ducting. The result was  an average 93% reduction in fugitive VOCs achieved in less than three months along with other results.

				<h2 class="editable">German/Japanese Healthcare Leader</h2>
				<p class="editable">The client wanted a holistic and integrated building improvement and wellness program for its Asia HQ. It was decided to undertake a significant upgrade of the facility including the creation of the primary Asia training facilities for the client’s end customers. The solution was to create a holistic and integrated building improvement program, using smart building and sustainability technology, to improve the client’s facility across a wide range of measurable areas. The cost savings from the energy and facility management initiatives subsidized the indoor environment and IT initiatives and provided an attractive payback for the whole program along with many other great results.
